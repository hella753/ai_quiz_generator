## Components

### Models
The backend uses Django ORM to define models representing entities like `User`, `UserAnswer`. `Answer`, `Quiz`, `Question`.

- **User**: Extended user model with custom fields and authentication methods.
- **Answer**: Contains fields: `answer`, `correct`, `question(fk)`
- **UserAnswer**: Contains fields: `answer`, `correct`, `question(fk)`, `user(fk)`, `guest`, `explanation` also method `get_score()`
- **Question**: Contains fields: `question`, `score`, `quiz(fk)`
- **Quiz**: Contains fields: `name`, `creator(fk)`
- **QuizScore**: Contains fields: `score`, `user(fk)`, `quiz(fk)`, `guest`
- **ModifiedTimeModel**: Abstract for adding creation and modification times.


### Serializers
Django Rest Framework serializers are used for converting model instances into JSON format and vice versa.

- **User app**: Contains serializers for User Creation, User Password Change, User Password Reset, Quiz Score and Analysis.
- **Quiz app**: Contains serializers for Quiz Creation, Quiz Update, Quiz Retrieve and Listing, Answer Checking, UserAnswer Creation.

### ViewSets and Views
Django Rest Framework Views and ViewSets are used for handling CRUD operations for models.

- **QuizViewSet**: Generates Quiz with AI and handles CRUD operations with the help of `QuizCreator` and `QuizUpdater`.
- **AnswerCheckerViewSet**: Checks answers with AI and creates UserAnswer objects with Total Score.
- **CreateUserViewSet**: Registers a new user.
- **TakenQuizViewSet**: Lists all quizzes user took.
- **CreatedQuizViewSet**: Lists all quizzes users created with statistics.
