## Components

### Models
The backend uses Django ORM to define models representing entities like `User`, `UserAnswer`. `Answer`, `Quiz`, `Question`.

- **User**: Extended user model with custom fields and authentication methods.
- **Answer**: Contains fields: `answer`, `correct`, `question(fk)`
- **UserAnswer**: Contains fields: `answer`, `correct`, `question(fk)`, `user(fk)`, `guest`, `explanation` also method `get_score()`
- **Question**: Contains fields: `question`, `score`, `quiz(fk)`
- **Quiz**: Contains fields: `name`, `creator(fk)`
- **ModifiedTimeModel**: Abstract for adding creation and modification times.


### Serializers
Django Rest Framework serializers are used for converting model instances into JSON format and vice versa.

- **AnswerSerializer**: Serializes answer data for CRUD operations.
- **QuestionSerializer**: Serializes question data for CRUD operations.
- **QuizSerializer**: Serializes quiz data for CRUD operations.
- **InputSerializer**: Serializes input data for quiz generating.
- **AnswerCheckerSerializer**: Serializes input data for checking answers.
- **UserAnswerCheckerSerializer**: Serializes output data for checking and creating answers.
- **RegistrationSerializer**: Serializes input data for user registration.
- **UserAnswerSerializer/UserQuestionSerializer/UserQuizSerializer**: Serializes data for personal account viewset.
- **QuizForCreatorSerializer**: Serializes data for quiz creator viewset.
- **CreatedQuizeDeatilSerializer**: Serializes data for quiz creator detail viewset.


### ViewSets
Django Rest Framework viewsets are used for handling CRUD operations for models.

- **QuizViewSet**: Generates Quiz and handles CRUD operations.
- **AnswerCheckerViewSet**: Checks answers with AI and creates UserAnswer objects.
- **CreateUserViewSet**: Registers a new user.
- **TakenQuizViewSet**: Lists all quizzes user took.
- **CreatedQuizViewSet**: Lists all quizzes user created with statistics.


### Permissions
- **IsCreater**: Custom permission for checking if the user is the creator of the quiz.
